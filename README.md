VR Chat Animator Toolkit
I Started this Project around the 14.02~


Project Ongoing, some Major issues still in code,
but basic functions and Layout were build.



What is this Tool?:
Its planned to be a Wide Toolbox of new Features that allow for Smoother Developement on Avatars,
Fast Accessible UIs, Automatic Functions, Debugging
Currently Focused on the Animator, but i generally look out for expansion on other types of functionalitys



What is planned for Future:
  Features will be added based on Evaluation and Ideas, theres no specific Goal





Read Wiki for Function Descriptions

The Addon is maybe Fragile, feel free to test it, but keep in mind that it could potentially kill the Controller you are working on

Planned UI Draft (Left) + Current State (Right):
